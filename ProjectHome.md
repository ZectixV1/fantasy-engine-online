This project attempts to provide a scriptable 2D graphical Multi User Dungeon based on the RPG elements and gameplay style defined within the Final Fantasy games. Data is sent on a need to access bases, such data from the server will be cachable (to prevent repeat requests unless updated). Networking will be based on a modified IRC protocol, client-server based. With text based IRC clients being able to connect to the server too. Each channel represents a Zone within the universe and the server will decide which positional update packets will be sent to players based on a visability threshold.
